/**
 * Maps your domain models to resources that Vulcan can understand.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code ScopedCollectionResources} are a special type of {@code
 * CollectionResource} that are meant to be exposed dependent of another {@code
 * CollectionResource}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Resources behave like an API so you must add the API's name via the {@link
 * #getName()} method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Representors created by the method {@link
 * CollectionResource#buildRepresentor(
 * com.liferay.vulcan.resource.builder.RepresentorBuilder)} hold all the
 * information needed to write your domain models' hypermedia representations.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Finally, you can add the different supported routes for the resource via the
 * method {@link
 * CollectionResource#routes(
 * com.liferay.vulcan.resource.builder.RoutesBuilder)}.
